# RA - docs
BCDevExchange RA-documents, are notorious for bad spelling and other useful things. If you'd like to participate - feel free to comment or add an <a rel="issues" href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange/RA-Documents/issues">issue</a>, we'd love to hear from you.

This Project creates the HELP documents for a searchable database and showcase of archival documents and materials. It is a key component of enabling on-line access to the artefacts of the history of BC for researchers, historians and the general public. 
Check out the Project Documentation or jump right into the Issue Log for more information on the project.
